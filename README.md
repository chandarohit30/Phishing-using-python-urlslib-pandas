# Phishing-using-python-urlslib-pandas
Main idea of this project is to implement an anti phishing algorithm using Machine learning. Phishing is popular among attackers, since it is easier to trick someone into clicking a malicious link which seems legitimate. This project employs Machine-learning technique for modelling the prediction task and supervised learning algorithms namely Random Forest are used for exploring the results. Phishing is the process of hacking user’s security information like bank accounts, credit card numbers… by sending URL’s through Gmail’s, SMS, … our project recognize the provided URL is phishing URL or legitimate URL.


•Random forest algorithm is one of the most powerful algorithms in machine learning technology and it is based on concept of decision tree algorithm.
•Random forest algorithm creates the forest with number of decision trees. High number of tree gives high detection accuracy.
•Random Forest is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to perform both regression and classification task in data mining.
•It is an ensemble based technique that can be used to perform classification. It makes use of a number of classification trees (like decision trees) and then gives the final result
